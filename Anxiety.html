  </ul>
  </div> 
  <h3>Treatments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Therapy</li>
    <li>Medication</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs relieve symptoms by blocking the reabsorption, or reuptake, of serotonin by certain nerve cells in the brain. This leaves more serotonin available, which improves mood. They are considered an effective treatment for all anxiety disorders, although the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, typically requires higher doses.</li>
      <li>Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs): The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or SNRI, class (venlafaxine and duloxetine) is notable for a dual mechanism of action: increasing the levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine by inhibiting their reabsorption into cells in the brain. These medications are considered as effective as SSRIs, so they are also considered a first-line treatment for the treatment of anxiety disorders, but not for obsessive compulsive disorder ,where SSRIs are the preferred first line treatment.</li>
      <li>Benzodiazepines: This class of drugs is frequently used for short-term management of anxiety and as an add on treatment, in treatment resistant anxiety disorders. Long-term use may require increased doses to achieve the same effect, which may lead to problems related to tolerance and dependence.</li>
